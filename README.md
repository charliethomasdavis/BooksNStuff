### Contribution
Contribute changes to this project by following these steps:

#### Clone the project to your machine
Before you can contribute, you need to have a local copy of the code on your machine. Cloning is the first step, but in order to have any changes reflected on this repository, you must **fork** this repository.

1. First, you'll need to set up Git on your machine. For Windows, I recommend installing [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/).

2. You also need to create a new GitHub account if you don't already have one.

3. Follow the instructions [on this GitHub Help page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) to create a copy of this repository on your account AND clone your repository to your local machine.

#### Use git to track your changes

1. Use the `git status` command to see what files are tracked. This will show you any tracked files that have changes.

2. Use `git add <filename>` for each file you've made changes to that you want git to track.

3. **Commit** your changes each time you add a new feature using `git commit -m 'Short description of change'`.

#### Keep up to date with this repository
Your fork will not automatically be updated when others make changs to this main repo. You need to pull changes from this main repository before you begin making changes to your local copy.

1. Add original repository as remote: `git remote add upstream git://github.com/charliethomasdavis/BooksNStuff.git`

2. Fetch and merge the changes from upstream into your branch: `git pull upstream master`

#### Merge your changes with this repository

1. Push your changes to your fork using `git push origin <branchname>`. \<branchname\> is **master** if you haven't created any branches.
    
2. On github, navigate to [my repository](https://github.com/charliethomasdavis/BooksNStuff/).
